## Reddit **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**:

Writing by CoPilot of The City.

1. In the r/preppers community, one user shares their enthusiasm for HOCl as a disinfectant. They've done extensive research and find it to be their favorite disinfectant. HOCl kills viruses, mold, and bacteria, and you can use it almost anywhere you'd use water. It's safe on skin, not harmful to consume in small quantities, and even works as a hand sanitizer. Plus, it doesn't leave harmful residues like bleach does. The user generates their own HOCl as needed and extends its shelf life by tightly bottling it and avoiding light exposure¬π.

2. Over in r/Dryeyes, people discuss applying HOCl. Some spray it directly on their closed eyes and let it dry, while others use a cotton ball or pad to wipe their eyes with it¬≤.

3. In the r/ZeroWaste subreddit, users discuss HOCl and its effectiveness. They mention that under 100ppm is not effective, while over 250ppm is more potent than needed. Measuring free chlorine helps determine the HOCl concentration in water¬≥.

### **Taming HOCl‚Äôs Bitterness & Chlorine Smell (For Oral & Facial Use)**  

#### **1. Is HOCl‚Äôs Bitterness "Astringent"?**  
- **No**‚Äîit‚Äôs more **metallic/bleachy** than astringent (like black tea or unripe persimmon).  
- **Astringency** comes from tannins (e.g., in wine), which dry tissues. HOCl doesn‚Äôt do that.  

#### **2. Masking Chlorine Smell in Facial Sprays**  
*(HOCl is a superstar for acne/rosacea, but that pool-water whiff needs fixing.)*  

##### **Safe, Cosmetic-Grade Masking Agents**  
‚úÖ **Lavender Hydrosol**  
  - **Ratio:** 70% HOCl (100‚Äì200 ppm) + 30% lavender hydrosol.  
  - **Why?** Floral aroma neutralizes chlorine, plus **anti-redness** benefits.  

‚úÖ **Aloe Vera Juice**  
  - **Ratio:** 50% HOCl + 50% pure aloe juice.  
  - **Why?** Adds a fresh, green scent + soothes skin.  

‚úÖ **Niacinamide Serum (Pre-Mixed)**  
  - **Ratio:** 80% HOCl + 20% niacinamide serum (5%).  
  - **Why?** Niacinamide has a **neutral smell** and boosts HOCl‚Äôs anti-inflammatory effects.  

‚úÖ **Peppermint or Tea Tree EO (Diluted!)**  
  - **Ratio:** 1 drop per 30mL HOCl (0.1% concentration).  
  - **Why?** Mint/tea tree overpower chlorine **without** irritating skin (if properly diluted).  

##### **Avoid:**  
‚ùå **Citrus Oils** (phototoxic).  
‚ùå **Heavy Fragrances** (can destabilize HOCl).  

#### **3. Best HOCl Facial Spray Protocol**  
1. **Start with stable HOCl (100‚Äì200 ppm, pH 5‚Äì7).**  
2. **Mix with aloe/lavender hydrosol** (shake well).  
3. **Store in amber glass** (light degrades HOCl).  
4. **Spritz on clean skin**‚Äîlet dry (no rinsing).  

**Bonus:** Add **1% glycerin** if skin feels dry (HOCl can be slightly drying).  

---

### **Why This Works**  
- **HOCl‚Äôs chlorine smell** is volatile‚Äîmasking agents **absorb/neutralize** it.  
- **No efficacy loss** if mixed with **pH-compatible** ingredients (aloe, niacinamide).  
- **Proven in skincare** (e.g., Tower 28‚Äôs SOS Spray uses HOCl + minimal masking).  

**Final Tip:** Test mixes on **back of hand** first‚Äîsome noses are extra sensitive to chlorine!

### **Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl) Limits & Applications**  

#### **1. Oral Care: Safe Upper Limits**  
‚úÖ **Optimal Range:** **50‚Äì200 ppm** (most studies use 100‚Äì150 ppm for daily rinsing).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution at High Doses:**  
   - **>500 ppm** may cause **temporary taste distortion** (metallic/zinc-like).  
   - **>1,000 ppm** (rarely used orally) could irritate **mucosal tissues** (stinging).  
   - **No systemic toxicity**‚ÄîHOCl breaks down into **saltwater** in the body.  

üî¨ **Strange Effects?**  
   - **Overuse (>5x/day)** *might* disrupt **oral microbiome balance** (but less risk than chlorhexidine).  
   - **No enamel damage** (unlike peroxide/acidic rinses).  

#### **2. Food Prep: Yes, But Rinse Well**  
‚úÖ **Approved Uses:**  
   - **Sanitizing produce** (FDA-approved at 50‚Äì200 ppm, no rinse required for some applications).  
   - **Meat/poultry disinfection** (used in industrial processing).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **For Home Use:**  
   - Spray on food, wait **1‚Äì2 mins**, then **rinse with water** (av
