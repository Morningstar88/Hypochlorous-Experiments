## Reddit **hypochlorous acid (HOCl)**:

Writing by CoPilot of The Emerald City.

1. In the r/preppers community, one user shares their enthusiasm for HOCl as a disinfectant. They've done extensive research and find it to be their favorite disinfectant. HOCl kills viruses, mold, and bacteria, and you can use it almost anywhere you'd use water. It's safe on skin, not harmful to consume in small quantities, and even works as a hand sanitizer. Plus, it doesn't leave harmful residues like bleach does. The user generates their own HOCl as needed and extends its shelf life by tightly bottling it and avoiding light exposure¹.

2. Over in r/Dryeyes, people discuss applying HOCl. Some spray it directly on their closed eyes and let it dry, while others use a cotton ball or pad to wipe their eyes with it².

3. In the r/ZeroWaste subreddit, users discuss HOCl and its effectiveness. They mention that under 100ppm is not effective, while over 250ppm is more potent than needed. Measuring free chlorine helps determine the HOCl concentration in water³.
